This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

## Week 4 Assessment Practice

Create a react calculator app that has 2 number input components and a result component. It should add, subtract, multiply, or divide the numbers and prints the value to the result component. Bonus: make it take 3 number input components.

We have added Redux to this project, which is likely unnecessary.
